### Self-Stabilizing Resonance Field AI Module  
**Defensive Publication Repository**

---

## 📜 Abstract
**hexOSAI v1** introduces a modular *resonance-field architecture* for adaptive, self-stabilizing AI systems.  
It achieves dynamic coherence through **coupled field synchronization**, **noise-driven adaptation**, and **integrity-based recovery**.  
This repository serves as the **official defensive publication** establishing prior art under the *Humanity Heritage License (HHL-π)*.

## ⚙️ Core Idea
The system treats noise not as an error, but as an informational driver of balance.  
Each field unit adapts to maintain global coherence using measurable quantities:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| ω | Oscillation rate |
| δ | Dissipation |
| ν | Variation (noise amplitude) |
| C | Coherence |
| S | Stability |
| H | Entropy |
| N | Noise level |
| I | Integrity (weighted system balance) |

Integrity is computed as:  
I = σ((C + S + (1 − H)) / 3) × (1 − 0.3N)
σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e⁻⁸(x − 0.5))

## ✨ Vision
hexOSAI aims to redefine intelligence as **a resonance between order and chaos** —  
a computational field that breathes, self-balances, and remembers.  
Technology in harmony with the laws of nature, not against them.
