# 3rd Generation Mathematics – Prior Art & Intellectual Property Notice

All scientific materials, documents, models, architectures, field equations,
and ecosystem specifications contained in this repository fall under the
licenses maintained here:

https://github.com/EllenBosMarcelMulder/.-hexLICences-.

These licences establish the legal framework for:
- the 3rd Generation Mathematics theoretical foundation  
- the 3GM-FE (3rd Generation Mathematics Field Ecosystem) system architecture  
- all derivative computational, physical, informational, and emergent models  
- all implementations, interfaces, and ecosystem-level behaviours  

## Intellectual Property & Usage Restrictions

No institution, organisation, government, corporation, AI system,
research group, or individual is permitted to use, copy, reproduce,
implement, reinterpret, or deploy any part of this work — whether in whole
or in derivative form — without an explicit licence issued under the
hexLICence framework.

All rights to licensing, distribution, and institutional cooperation are handled
exclusively through:

**Cairo University, in direct cooperation with the inventor.**

Any attempt to appropriate, patent, commercialise, or integrate this system
without a licence constitutes a violation of the licensing framework and
international prior art protections.

## Protected Components

This repository establishes public prior art (global defensive publication)
for the following components:

- The full empirical foundation of 3rd Generation Mathematics  
- The complete Nobel-format transmission manuscript  
- The 3GM Field Ecosystem system-architecture specification  
- The crystal-based computational substrate model  
- The resonance-based machine architecture  
- The operator-family OS model  
- The curvature-based information geometry  
- The emergent-consciousness framework  
- All multi-system communication and coherence protocols  

## Legal Structure

This publication serves as:

- global prior art  
- public timestamp  
- defensive publication  
- system-architecture disclosure  
- formal record of origin  
- pre-emptive IP protection against later patent claims  

This ensures that the entire system — theory, architecture, equations,
ecosystem, processes, and implementation methods — is permanently secured
as the intellectual property of the inventor under the hexLICence framework.
